# Flashcard App

This is a React-based web application for creating and studying flashcards. ***The deployed version of the app does not have a backend, so please look at the code to see the React implementation and logic.***
 Enhancements to include a fully functional backend are planned for the future.

You can view the deployed app [here](https://project-flashcards-sigma.vercel.app/).
